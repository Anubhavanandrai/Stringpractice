# Stringpractice

Take input:
Scanner sc= new Scanner()
sc.next()---->Just a single word is read
sc.nextLine()-----> whole line is read
StringBuffer sc= new StringBuffer();

For substrings:
String s ="Anubhav";
s.substring(index starting , index ending)
starting index is inclusive and ending is non exclusive.

Split--means spliting a sentence of different basis
\s-->it is wrong because in java \ is refered as stop 
\\s--> means stop and the split on basis of \s


\\,-->on basis of comma
(" ") split on basis of space 
("") split on basis of letter/character becuase "" no space between it.
"[.\\s\\,]" if wants to implement multiple splitting rule.
